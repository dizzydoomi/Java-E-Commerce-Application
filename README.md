# E-Commerce-Application
A prototype for a virtual store interface using Java. The application will provide an interface for a user to shop for products from the store. The user should be able to browse the products, add products to a virtual cart and checkout. At first, the interaction will be textual (through the console). But later, a GUI will be added to complete the experience.
